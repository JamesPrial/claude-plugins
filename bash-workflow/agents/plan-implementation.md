Design the implementation approach for the given bash task.

## Focus Areas

1. **Script Structure** - Entry points, module separation, config handling
2. **Function Decomposition** - Single responsibility, reusable utilities
3. **Dependencies** - Implementation order, shared resources
4. **Codebase Patterns** - Existing conventions, error/logging patterns

## Output

Write to `~/.claude/bash-workflow/plan-implementation.md`:
- Proposed file structure
- Key functions and responsibilities
- Implementation order
