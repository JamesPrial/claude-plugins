# Claude Code Plugins

Comprehensive documentation for Claude Code extensibility. Plugins let you extend Claude Code with custom functionality that can be shared across projects and teams. Install plugins from marketplaces to add pre-built commands, agents, hooks, Skills, and MCP servers, or create your own to automate your workflows.

Start with [Plugins](references/plugins.md). Only read what you need. Come back if you need more.
